# Machine-Learning-and-Statistics

This repository was created to house the assignment for Machine Learning and Statistics assingment in GMIT.

### Assignment Requirements Below

Create a GitHub repository containing two Jupyter notebooks – these are described
further down. The repository should contain the following:
10% A clear and informative README.md explaining why the repository exists, what is
in it, and how to run the notebooks.
10% A requirements.txt file that enables someone to quickly run your notebooks
with minimal configuration. You should also include any other required files such
as data files and image files.

#### Scikit-Learn Jupyter Notebook
Include a Jupyter notebook called scikit-learn.ipynb that contains the following.
10% A clear and concise overview of the scikit-learn Python library [3].
20% Demonstrations of three interesting scikit-learn algorithms. You may choose
these yourself, based on what is covered in class or otherwise. Note that the
demonstrations are at your discretion – you may choose to have an overall spread
of examples across the library or pick a particular part that you find interesting.
10% Appropriate plots and other visualisations to enhance your notebook for viewers.

#### Scipy Stats Jupyter Notebook
Include a Jupyter notebook called scipy-stats.ipynb that contains the following.
10% A clear and concise overview of the scipy.stats Python library [4].
20% An example hypothesis test using ANOVA. You should find a data set on which
it is appropriate to use ANOVA, ensure the assumptions underlying ANOVA are
met, and then perform and display the results of your ANOVA using scipy.stats.
10% Appropriate plots and other visualisations to enhance your notebook for viewers.

### Contents
The folder contains a text file explaining briefly how to run the other files.
This read.me file explaining the assignment.
Scikit-Learn notebook, containing 3 examples of the scikit-learn functions, including K Nearest Neighbours,
Support Vector Machine and Random Forrest Modelling carried out on the IRIS dataset.
The Scipy-Stats notebook carries out an ANOVA assessment on the Balance-Scales.csv file.
